# My Tech Setup: A Look into My Development Environment

As a developer, having the right tools and environment is essential for productivity and efficiency. In this blog post, I'll be sharing my tech setup and dev environment, including the hardware, software, and accessories that I use daily. Whether you're just starting or looking to upgrade your setup, I hope this post provides some inspiration and useful information.

## Hardware

My primary workstation is a **Lenovo ThinkBook 14**, with 16GB of RAM, AMD Ryzen 7 CPU, and AMD Vega 8 integrated graphics. I've found that these specs are enough to handle my development workflow, and I'm even able to do some light gaming on it.
On it, I run **Arch Linux** as my main OS, with **KDE Plasma** as my preferred Desktop Environment.

## Software

When it comes to software, I rely on a few key tools to help me with my daily tasks.

### Editor/IDE

My text editor of choice is **[VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium#why-does-this-exist)**.
Here are some of my favorite extensions:

- [Vim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim)
- [Gruvbox material theme](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material-vscode.git)
- [Git Lens](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens.git)
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode)
- [Colorize](https://github.com/kamikillerto/vscode-colorize.git)

I also use **NeoVim**, whenever I need to do some light work.

### Browsers

For browsers, I use **Firefox** for day-to-day use, and **Google Chrome** for development, as I find the tools Chrome provides are much better when developing websites.

### Shell + Terminal

I use **[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)** as my default terminal and **ZSH** as my default shell, configured with **[Oh-My-ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/)** which help to make my experience much better and faster.

### Notes

For note-taking, I use **Joplin**, which plenty of customization through plugins and easy sync between devices.
In the past, I've used **Notion** for while but found that I can be pretty distracting by trying to make your notes look good. Then I tried **Obsidian** which in some ways is much better than Joplin, but syncing between devices can be a hassle unless you use their paid services, and also like Notion it's not FOSS.

## Accessories

In addition to my hardware and software, there are a few accessories that I find essential for my work. For my audio setup, I use a **Hifiman HE400se** (headphones), a **KZ ZEX Pro** (IEM), and a **Tanchjim Ola** (IEM), which are all budget devices but deliver phenomenal audio experiences.

For the keyboard I have **Keychron K6**, with Gateron Red switches, I also added 2 layers of foam inside to help improve the sound. And for my mouse, I use a **Logitech G304**.
